	<h1>Breakup Ball Bingo</h1>
	<p><i>Breakup Ball Bingo</i> is a scavenger hunt-style game of bingo where each user can fill out a bingo board in real-time on our <a href="https://matthewd0123.github.io/breakup-ball-bingo/">GitHub Pages website</a> upon witnessing the events listed on the bingo board at "Breakup Ball". If the player witnesses one of the 24 events listed on the bingo board, he/she/they can mark that event off by clicking on the cell that contains that event.<i> Please see example Breakup Ball Bingo board below.</i><br>
	<img src="./board.PNG" alt="bingo board"><br>
	A Firebase database is linked to the application to keep track of each player's bingo board and interesting stories that are witnessed at "Breakup Ball."

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To use our version of <i>Breakup Ball Bingo</i>, just visit our <a href="https://matthewd0123.github.io/breakup-ball-bingo/">website</a>.</p>
  <p>However, because the game is open-source, you can create your own version of <i>Breakup Ball Bingo</i> by forking the <a href="https://github.com/matthewd0123/breakup-ball-bingo">GitHub repository</a> that houses the application's code. After forking the repository, you can edit the bingo board to add your own events by modifying the lines of code in <b>bingo.html</b> that have <span style="color: yellow;">TODO</span> comments. <i>Note: You can edit the code in your preferred text editor or IDE. You do not need to download or install any addtional packages to run the code, as the codebase consists of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</i> Next, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup">add Firebase</a> to your application, and edit the lines of code in <b>bingo.html</b> below the comment "<span style="color: yellow;">TODO</span>: Initialize Firebase" with the data pertaining to your Firebase instance. Finally, to host your own GitHub Pages website with the bingo application, navigate to the repository on GitHub and click on the project's settings. Scroll down on the <b>Settings</b> page until you see the <b>GitHub Pages</b> header. From here, select the <i>Source</i> to be "<i>master branch</i>". Your personalized instance of <i>Breakup Ball Bingo</i> should now be published at the URL given to you by GitHub.</p>
