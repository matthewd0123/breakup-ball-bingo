	<h1>Breakup Ball Bingo</h1>
	<p><i>Breakup Ball Bingo</i> is a scavenger hunt-style game of bingo where each user can fill out a bingo board in real-time on our <a href="https://matthewd0123.github.io/breakup-ball-bingo/">GitHub Pages website</a> upon witnessing the events listed on the bingo board at "Breakup Ball". If the player witnesses one of the 24 events listed on the bingo board, he/she/they can mark that event off by clicking on the cell that contains that event.<i> Please see example Breakup Ball Bingo board below.</i><br>
